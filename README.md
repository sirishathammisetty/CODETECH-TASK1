Overview of the project 
Project : LED BLINKING WITH ARDUINO
Objective
The objective of the LED blinking project with Arduino is to introduce fundamental concepts of microcontroller programming and electronics. Specifically, it aims to

Learn Basic Arduino Programming: Understand the structure of an Arduino sketch (setup and loop functions).Get familiar with basic functions like pinMode(), digitalWrite(), and delay().
Understand Hardware-Software Interaction: Learn how to set up a simple circuit with an LED and a resistor.Understand how to control an external component (LED) using a microcontroller (Arduino).
Develop Problem-Solving Skills: Practice debugging simple hardware and software issues.Experiment with code modifications to observe different behaviors.
Gain Confidence in Using Arduino: Build confidence in using the Arduino IDE and uploading code to the Arduino board.Get comfortable with the process of connecting the Arduino to a computer and setting up a basic project.
TECHNOLOGIES USED
Programming language : The code for Arduino is written in a simplified version of C or C++
Microcontroller : Arduino Board is one of the most popular open source microcontroller platform based on easy to use hardware and software.
